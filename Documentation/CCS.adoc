CCS Software
-------------

The CCS board will be connected to both CAN busses as well as outputting the telemetry stream to the Primary Pi. CCS will act as the bridge between the two CAN networks.

CCS has two responsibilities, the first is to pass information from the CAN networks into the telemetry stream to be forwarded out. The second is to relay driver controls to the motor controllers.
