# CCS Software

The primary responsibility of the CCS is to take all the information on the 500Khz CAN Network (CAN2), package the information into serial data, and send it to the Raspberry Pi over UART.

In addition, the CCS also receives messages from the driver controls, and will activate the horn when it is pressed.

## CAN Inputs
|=======================
|*CAN Address* |*Name* |*Purpose*
|0x703 | Driver Inputs | Contains information on if the horn is pressed
|=======================

## Serial Output

See the https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gtCKN7LzG7e8XRzbGrN5uUiLGr7miS0QCEm0QNylUyM/edit#gid=0[Elysia Communications Protocol] for messages that the CCS forwards to the Raspberry Pi & the breakdown of the serial packets.

## Unused CAN Network

CAN1 was originally intended to house older external systems(eg. Tritium BMS) that could only run on 250Khz networks.
However, those have been replaced with systems that can be run on 500Khz.
As a result, CAN1 is currently unused.
