Embedded Recruit Training 
------------------------

In this recruit training you will be receiving two “control” CAN messages, one for the blue LED and the green LED. Depending on which bits are ‘set’ you will toggle either the blue or green LEDS. You will also send back a message with current state of the LEDs at a frequency of 1hz for the blue LED and 10Hz for the green. 

We will begin by discussing the directory structure for the recruit training project.

*  Core: where all of the user/main code will go
** inc: where all of the header files go 
** src: where all of the source files go 
* Drivers: where all the HAL driver functions go
* Middlewares: where all of the os functions (FREERTOS and CMSIS) are

If there are any functions that you think you need, but aren't given, refer to Documentation/HALFunctionReferences.adoc and Documentation/RTOSReferences.adoc


Start by going to Core/Src/main.c and search for “TODO” this will show you where you need to make changes

. Within “USER CODE BEGIN Includes” and “USER CODE END Includes”
.. Include all task header files, these will be found under Core/Inc and have “Task” in the filename
. Within “USER CODE BEGIN PV” and “USER CODE END PV”
.. Add the StdId for the green led, this value will be 0XBBB, look to blue StdId for an example
.. Add CAN Tx Header definition. The type is `CAN_TxHeaderTypeDef`
.. Define threads for the blue and green toggle LED tasks. The type will be `osThreadId_t`
.. Define toggle flags for blue and green LEDs. The type will be `uint8_t`
. Within “USER CODE BEGIN 2” and “USER CODE END 2”
.. Call the function `MX_CAN2_UserInit`, it takes no arguments
. Within “USER CODE BEGIN RTOS MUTEX” and “USER CODE END RTOS MUTEX”
.. Create mutexes for CAN transmit
... To create a mutex:
.... Define a mutex handle of `osMutexId_t`
.... Define attributes of const `osMutexAttr_t`
..... This is a struct and will be initialized with:
* String name 
* Zero
* Null
* Zero
..... Ex:
* `const osMutexAttr_t MutexAttr =
   {
       "MutexAttr", // name of mutex
       0, // TODO perhaps osMutexRecursive
       NULL,
       0
   };`
.... Call `osMutexNew()`
..... It accepts one argument of type `const osMutexAttr_t*` and its return type is `osMutexId_t`
..... Assign the value returned to the mutex handle you defined
. Within “USER CODE BEGIN RTOS THREADS” and “USER CODE ENDS RTOS THREADS”
.. Create blue and green thread handles and pass CAN transmit mutex handle as an argument  (The function prototypes can be found in the task header files)
... To create a thread:
.... Define attributes of `const osThreadAttr_t`
..... This is a struct and will be initialized with:
...... String task name 
...... Priority of type `osPriority_t`
....... We’ll usually only user `osPriorityNormal`
...... Stack size 
....... We’ll usually use a value of 128
..... Ex:
* `const osThreadAttr_t defaultTask_attributes = {
   .name = "defaultTask",
   .priority = (osPriority_t) osPriorityNormal,
   .stack_size = 128
 };`
.... Call `osThreadNew()`
..... It accepts three arguments:
...... Pointer to task function
....... This will be the name of your task
....... You will need to cast this to `osThreadFunc_t`
...... A pointer to any arguments being passed to your function
....... You will be passing the CAN Mutex you created earlier as an argument to both tasks
...... Pointer to attributes of `const osThreadAttr_t`
..... Assign the value returned to the thread handle you defined in step 2
. Within “USER CODE BEGIN 4” and “USER CODE END 4”
.. Inside `HAL_CAN_RxFifo0MsgPendingCallback`
... Match the StdId and the data length content in the header for the blue and green messages
.... The StdId in the header can be accessed by `hdr.StdId`
..... The StdId values were defined earlier in step 2
.... The data length content can be accessed by `hdr.DLC`
..... The data length content should be 1 byte
... Check data to see if the LED should be toggled. Data can be accessed by data array (`data`). This array stores individual bytes of data received
.... For blue LEDs if bits 0,3,7 are set (i.e. 1) then toggle 
.... For green LED if the lower two bits are set (i.e. 1) and upper six bits are not set (i.e. 0) then toggle
.. Inside `MX_CAN2_UserInit`
... Create the filter configuration for green messages
.... Follow the example given for the blue messages with the following differences:
..... `FilterBank = 1`
..... Use the green message StdId instead of the blue message StdId for `FilterIdHigh`
... Set initial configurations for the CAN Tx Header you created in step 2. Note: The Tx Header is a struct, so all elements can be accessed via the member access operator (.)
.... `ExtId = 0`
.... `RTR = CAN_RTR_DATA`
.... `IDE = CAN_ID_STD`
.... `TransmitGlobalTime = DISABLE`

Then go into Core/Inc/BlueLedToggleTask.h

. Define an external CAN handle (same variable as in main) of type `CAN_HandleTypeDef`
. Define an external CAN_Tx header (same variable as in main) of type `CAN_TxHeaderTypeDef`
. Define an external toggle flag for the blue LED (same variable as in main) of type `uint8_t `

Then go into Core/Inc/GreenLedToggleTask.h

. Do the same as in Core/Inc/BlueLedToggleTask.h, except the toggle flag should be for the green LED

Then go into Core/Src/BlueLedToggleTask.c

. Define a static constant global variable called `BLUE_LED_STATUS_STDID`
.. Give it a value of 0xCCC
. Define a `static const` variable called `BLUE_LED_TOGGLE_FREQ`
.. Set this value so that the task runs at a frequency of 1Hz
... Hint: this will be used in the `osDelayUntil` function call (the argument will be in time units of ms)
. In the `osDelayUntil` replace the current argument `prevWakeTime + 1` with `prevWakeTime + BLUE_LED_TOGGLE_FREQ`
.. This will cause the task to execute every `BLUE_LED_TOGGLE_FREQ` ms. 
. Check if the blue led toggle flag is set. If so, toggle the blue led. This will require a HAL GPIO function.
. Read the value of the blue led. This will require a HAL GPIO function.
. Send a CAN message indicating the current state of the led 
.. First you will try to acquire the mutex. This can be done by calling `osMutexAcquire`
... It’s arguments are `osMutexId_t*` and how long it should wait to acquire the mutex 
... The return type of this function is `osStatus_t`, if this is != to `osOK` then the mutex has not been acquired and you cannot use the CAN transmitter
.. If you successfully acquired the mutex, you must check if there are any free CAN mailboxes to transmit on 
... You can check this by calling `HAL_CAN_GetTxMailboxesFreeLevel`
.... This function accepts one argument which is of type `CAN_HandleTypeDef*`
.... This function returns the number of available mailboxes 
.. Next you will create a one element data array of type `uint8_t `
.. You will then create a mailbox variable of type `uint32_t`
.. You will then set the `StdId` of the CAN Tx Header to  `BLUE_LED_STATUS_STDID`
.. Then you will set the `DLC` to 1, because you are sending one byte 
.. Then you will set the only element of the data array to the current status of the LED 
... Note: because the LED is active low, the GPIO pin will read 0 when it is on and 1 when it is off. You are trying to send a 1 when the LED is on and a 0 when it is off 
.. You will then call `HAL_CAN_AddTxMessage` to send a message 
... This function takes arguments of `CAN_HandleTypeDef*`, `CAN_TxHeaderTypeDef*`, and `uint8_t*` (which will be your data array) and a `uint32_t*` (which will be the address of your mailbox variable)
... This function will return `HAL_StatusTypeDef`
.. You will then release the mutex by calling `osMutexRelease`
... This accepts arguments of `osMutexId_t*`
... *Note*: You must release the mutex even if you don't send a message.

Then go into Core/Src/GreenLedToggleTask.c

. Repeat the steps outlined above for the green LED, except give the `GREEN_LED_STATUS_STDID` a value of 0xDDD, and the frequency of the task is 10Hz.
