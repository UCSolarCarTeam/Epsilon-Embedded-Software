Unity Testing Tool (Mar. 23, 2019)

Unity is a testing tool by Throw The Switch. More information can be found 
at their website - http://www.throwtheswitch.org


Files Required for Unity Tests
------------------------------
If you have not already downloaded the Unity source files (or if it's not already in the
GIT repo), you can download them here: http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity/
 
The zip folder contains a sub folder called "src". The files contained in this folder
is all you really need to run a test. These files are:
    - unity.h
    - unity_internals.h
    - unity .c

Files containing the list of ASSERT statements  could be found under the "docs" folder.
Some useful files are:
    - UnityAssertionsCheatSheetSuitableforPrintingandPossiblyFraming,pdf
    - UnityAssertionsReference.md



        
Writing Test Modules
--------------------
Ideally, your test module is entirely different and seperate from the actual 
modules you're trying to test.

    1. Including the right files
    ----------------------------
    Your program must include the "unity.h" file (i.e there must be a #include "unity.h" in
    the compiled files.

    2. Test functions
    ------------------
    The actual testing occurs within the test functions. Test functions accept no arguments and
    return no values. You should have a test function for each function you will be testing.
    Here's an example of what a test function might look like:
    
    prototype of function to test : int add2Integers(int a, int b);
    
    Code listing (C):   
        void test_add2Integers(void)
        {
            TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_Int(expectedValue, add2Integers(a, b));
            //More ASSERT statements
        }
    
    3. Main Test file
    -----------------
    Your main test file should look similar to this:
    
    Code listing (C):
        //Include all files required for your functions to run
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        //Include required .h file for unity
        #include "unity.h"
        
        void test_add2Integers(void)
        {
            TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_Int(expectedValue, add2Integers(a, b));
            //More ASSERT statements
        }   
        
        int main (void)
        { 
           UNITY_BEGIN(); 
           
           //Run tests
           RUN_TEST(test_add2Integers);
           RUN_TEST(testFunctionOne);
           RUN_TEST(testFunctionTwo);
           RUN_TEST(testFunctionN)
           
           retrun UNITY_END();
           
         }
  
  
  
        
Compiling
---------
Be sure to compile include the src folder and compile unity.c along with all other 
files being compiled

CMD line:
    gcc -I UnityTestingTool/src testModuleFunctions.c main.c unity.c
